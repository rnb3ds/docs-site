# Security & Audit

DD's security stack consists of three independent but complementary components, covering the full chain from data redaction to audit traceability.

## Components

| Component | Responsibility | Typical Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| [SensitiveDataFilter](./security) | Auto-detect and redact sensitive data in logs | Prevent passwords, API keys, credit card numbers from leaking |
| [AuditLogger](./audit) | Asynchronously log security-related events | Compliance audit, security analysis, intrusion detection |
| [IntegritySigner](./integrity) | HMAC signing to prevent log tampering | Tamper detection, forensic evidence, compliance storage |

## How They Relate

```text
Log write pipeline:

  Logger.InfoWith(...)
       │
       ├─→ SensitiveDataFilter ──→ Redact field values (password → [REDACTED])
       │         │
       │         └─→ AuditLogger ──→ Async record redaction events
       │
       ├─→ Format output
       │
       └─→ IntegritySigner ──→ HMAC sign (tamper protection)
```

- **SensitiveDataFilter** intercepts sensitive data **before** logs are written
- **AuditLogger** records security events asynchronously without impacting log performance
- **IntegritySigner** signs logs **after** writing to ensure chain integrity

## Quick Selection

| Need | Recommended |
|------|------------|
| Prevent password/key leakage | [SensitiveDataFilter](./security) |
| Record who did what and when | [AuditLogger](./audit) |
| Ensure logs haven't been tampered | [IntegritySigner](./integrity) |
| Meet HIPAA/PCI-DSS compliance | All three together — see [Compliance](../../guides/security/compliance) |
