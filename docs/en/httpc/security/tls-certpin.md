# TLS and Certificate Pinning

## TLS Version Control

HTTPC requires TLS 1.2+ by default, rejecting the proven-insecure TLS 1.0/1.1. TLS 1.3 is recommended for stronger forward secrecy and a simpler handshake:

```go
cfg := httpc.DefaultConfig()
cfg.Security.MinTLSVersion = tls.VersionTLS12  // Default
cfg.Security.MaxTLSVersion = tls.VersionTLS13  // Default
```

### Version Details

| Version | Status | HTTPC Default |
|------|------|-----------|
| TLS 1.0 | Insecure, deprecated (POODLE/BEAST) | Rejected |
| TLS 1.1 | Insecure, deprecated | Rejected |
| TLS 1.2 | Secure | Minimum requirement |
| TLS 1.3 | Most secure, recommended (forward secrecy mandated) | Supported |

:::tip
To force TLS 1.3 only (higher security, simpler handshake), set `MinTLSVersion = tls.VersionTLS13`. Note that some legacy clients/proxies may not support TLS 1.3; confirm the target service is compatible before enabling.
:::

:::warning
Once `Security.TLSConfig` is set, `MinTLSVersion` and `MaxTLSVersion` **are ignored** — the settings inside `TLSConfig` take precedence. To control versions inside a custom `TLSConfig`, set `TLSConfig.MinVersion` / `MaxVersion`.
:::

## Cipher Suites

The default configuration allows only secure cipher suites (ECDHE family enforcing forward secrecy, AEAD encryption):

| Cipher Suite | Description |
|----------|------|
| `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` | Recommended |
| `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` | Recommended |
| `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305` | Recommended |
| `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` | Recommended |
| `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` | Recommended |
| `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305` | Recommended |

TLS 1.3 cipher suites are negotiated automatically by the protocol and are not controlled by the `CipherSuites` field.

## Custom TLS Configuration

For fine-grained control (custom CA, mTLS, pinning specific cipher suites), set `Security.TLSConfig`:

```go
cfg := httpc.DefaultConfig()
cfg.Security.TLSConfig = &tls.Config{
    MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS13,  // Force TLS 1.3
    // Other custom settings
}
```

### Custom CA Certificate

To connect to services signed by an internal CA (enterprise internal PKI, self-signed certificates), load a custom root certificate:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/tls"
	"crypto/x509"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/cybergodev/httpc"
)

func main() {
	caCert, err := os.ReadFile("custom-ca.pem")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	caCertPool := x509.NewCertPool()
	if !caCertPool.AppendCertsFromPEM(caCert) {
		log.Fatal("failed to parse CA certificate")
	}

	cfg := httpc.DefaultConfig()
	cfg.Security.TLSConfig = &tls.Config{
		RootCAs:    caCertPool,
		MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,
	}

	client, err := httpc.New(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer func() { _ = client.Close() }()
	log.Println("custom-CA client ready")
}
```

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

When the server requires a client certificate (mTLS), configure the `Certificates` field:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/tls"
	"log"

	"github.com/cybergodev/httpc"
)

func main() {
	cert, err := tls.LoadX509KeyPair("client-cert.pem", "client-key.pem")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	cfg := httpc.DefaultConfig()
	cfg.Security.TLSConfig = &tls.Config{
		Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert},
		MinVersion:   tls.VersionTLS12,
	}

	client, err := httpc.New(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer func() { _ = client.Close() }()
	log.Println("mTLS client ready")
}
```

:::tip
mTLS is common in zero-trust networks, service-mesh internal authentication, and financial APIs. The server identifies the caller via the client certificate, with no extra token needed. During certificate rotation, `client-cert.pem` / `client-key.pem` must be updated in sync.
:::

## Certificate Pinning

Certificate pinning layers an additional check **on top of** standard certificate-chain validation: it requires a known pinned public key/certificate to be present in the server's certificate chain. Even if a trusted CA is compromised or coerced into issuing a forged certificate, an attacker still cannot perform a MITM — because the public key of their certificate does not match the pinned value.

### How It Works

Standard TLS validation: the client trusts any certificate signed by a trusted CA. Certificate pinning: the client additionally requires the certificate's public-key hash to match a pre-stored value.

```
Standard validation:  trust CA -> trust any certificate signed by that CA
Certificate pinning:  trust CA + certificate's public key must match the pre-stored hash
```

Pinning layers on top of standard validation — no need to set `InsecureSkipVerify`. HTTPC validates **any layer** of the certificate chain, so pinning the intermediate certificate remains valid after the leaf certificate is renewed.

### SPKI Hash Generation Steps

The SPKI (SubjectPublicKeyInfo) hash is the most common pinning format (HPKP standard). Generation steps:

**Step 1**: obtain the server certificate (export from a browser, or use openssl)

```bash
# Fetch the certificate chain from the server
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -showcerts < /dev/null 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -outform pem > cert.pem
```

**Step 2**: extract the public key from the certificate -> DER-encode -> SHA-256 -> base64

```bash
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -pubkey -noout | \
  openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | \
  openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | \
  openssl enc -base64
# Output: YLh1dUR9y6Kja30RrAn7JKnbQG/uEtLMkBgFF2fuihg=
```

Three-step breakdown:

| Step | Command fragment | Purpose |
|------|---------|------|
| Extract public key | `openssl x509 -pubkey -noout` | Extract the PEM-format public key from the X.509 certificate |
| DER-encode | `openssl pkey -pubin -outform der` | Convert the PEM public key to DER (PKIX) format |
| Hash-encode | `openssl dgst -sha256 -binary \| openssl enc -base64` | SHA-256 then base64-encode |

:::tip
Pinning the **intermediate certificate**'s SPKI is recommended over the leaf certificate. Intermediate certificates are long-lived (typically 5-10 years); when the leaf certificate is renewed (e.g. Let's Encrypt's 90 days), the intermediate stays the same, so the pinned value does not need frequent updates.
:::

### SPKI Hash Pinning (Recommended)

`NewSPKIHashPinner` accepts one or more base64-encoded SHA-256 SPKI hashes. Providing multiple hashes supports key rotation — any match passes:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/tls"
	"log"

	"github.com/cybergodev/httpc"
)

func main() {
	pinner, err := httpc.NewSPKIHashPinner(
		"YLh1dUR9y6Kja30RrAn7JKnbQG/uEtLMkBgFF2fuihg=", // current intermediate
		"C5+lpZ7tcVwmwQIMcRtPbsQtWLABXhQzejna0wHFr8M=", // backup (key rotation)
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	cfg := httpc.DefaultConfig()
	cfg.Security.MinTLSVersion = tls.VersionTLS12
	cfg.Security.CertificatePinner = pinner
	client, err := httpc.New(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer func() { _ = client.Close() }()
	log.Println("certificate-pinning client ready")
}
```

`NewSPKIHashPinner` returns an error when the hashes are empty or not valid base64, exposing configuration problems at startup. Validation logic: iterate every layer of the server's certificate chain, compute each SPKI's SHA-256, and pass if any matches a pinned hash.

:::tip
`CertificatePinner` layers pinning validation **on top of** standard TLS chain validation — no need to set `InsecureSkipVerify`. Validation applies to any layer of the certificate chain, so pinning the intermediate remains valid after the leaf certificate is renewed.
:::

### Three Pinner Constructors Compared

HTTPC provides three Pinner constructors for different scenarios:

| Constructor | Input | Applicable scenario | Recommendation |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| `NewSPKIHashPinner` | base64 SHA-256 SPKI hash | Most common (HPKP format) | Recommended |
| `NewPublicKeyPinner` | DER-encoded PKIX public key | When you already hold raw public-key bytes | Convenience |
| `NewCertificatePinnerChain` | Multiple pinners | Combining strategies / mixed rotating keys | Advanced |

```go
// 1. SPKI hash (recommended, most common)
spkiPinner, err := httpc.NewSPKIHashPinner(
    "YLh1dUR9y6Kja30RrAn7JKnbQG/uEtLMkBgFF2fuihg=",
)

// 2. DER public key (when you already have raw public-key bytes; SHA-256 computed internally)
pubPinner, err := httpc.NewPublicKeyPinner(pubKeyDER1, pubKeyDER2)

// 3. Combine multiple pinners; any match accepts (mixed strategies or rotating keys across constructors)
chainPinner := httpc.NewCertificatePinnerChain(spkiPinner, pubPinner)
cfg.Security.CertificatePinner = chainPinner
```

`NewCertificatePinnerChain` with no arguments returns a "deny-all" Pinner (secure default), ensuring a configuration omission is never silently passed off as "allow all".

### Custom CertificatePinner

For advanced scenarios needing a custom pinning strategy (e.g. pinning the full certificate rather than the public key, or dynamically fetching pinned values from a config center), implement the `CertificatePinner` interface directly:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/sha256"
	"crypto/tls"
	"crypto/x509"
	"encoding/base64"
	"errors"
	"log"

	"github.com/cybergodev/httpc"
)

// fullCertPinner pins the SHA-256 of the full certificate (rather than the public-key SPKI).
type fullCertPinner struct {
	pinnedHashes map[string]bool
}

func newFullCertPinner(hashes ...string) *fullCertPinner {
	m := make(map[string]bool, len(hashes))
	for _, h := range hashes {
		m[h] = true
	}
	return &fullCertPinner{pinnedHashes: m}
}

// Pin implements the CertificatePinner interface, returning a description of the pinned value (for logging/debugging).
func (p *fullCertPinner) Pin() string {
	return "full-cert-pinner"
}

// VerifyPeerCertificate implements the CertificatePinner interface.
// Returns nil to accept, non-nil to reject the handshake.
func (p *fullCertPinner) VerifyPeerCertificate(rawCerts [][]byte, verifiedChains [][]*x509.Certificate) error {
	if len(verifiedChains) == 0 || len(verifiedChains[0]) == 0 {
		return errors.New("certificate pinning failed: empty chain")
	}
	for _, cert := range verifiedChains[0] {
		sum := sha256.Sum256(cert.Raw)
		hash := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(sum[:])
		if p.pinnedHashes[hash] {
			return nil // Match, accept
		}
	}
	return errors.New("certificate pinning failed: no matching certificate")
}

func main() {
	// Pin the SHA-256 of the full leaf certificate (must be updated after certificate renewal)
	pinner := newFullCertPinner(
		"wert6uY/PCq3yAAbZA/wtqfzfQsTwmxnfv6I3vRz1XQ=", // SHA-256 of the certificate Raw
	)

	cfg := httpc.DefaultConfig()
	cfg.Security.TLSConfig = &tls.Config{MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12}
	cfg.Security.CertificatePinner = pinner
	client, err := httpc.New(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer func() { _ = client.Close() }()
	log.Println("custom certificate-pinning client ready")
}
```

:::warning
When implementing a custom `CertificatePinner`, always layer pinning validation on top of standard certificate-chain validation (`verifiedChains`). Never use it to replace standard validation — keep `InsecureSkipVerify = false` at all times.
:::

## Multiple Hashes and Key Rotation

Both `NewSPKIHashPinner` and `NewPublicKeyPinner` accept multiple values; any match passes. This is the key to key rotation: pin both the old and new public keys at the same time, so both old and new certificates pass during the rotation window — no downtime needed for the switch.

Rotation workflow:

1. The server generates a new key pair and issues a new certificate
2. The client updates the pinned values, **keeping both old and new hashes**:
   ```go
   pinner, _ := httpc.NewSPKIHashPinner(
       "OLD_HASH...", // Old key (kept during rotation)
       "NEW_HASH...", // New key (about to activate)
   )
   ```
3. Deploy the client; confirm both old and new certificates pass
4. The server switches to the new certificate
5. After observing a trouble-free period, remove the old hash from the pinned values

:::danger
A pinning failure (pinned value not matching) causes the connection to fail completely and cannot recover automatically. Be sure to:
- **Always keep at least one backup pinned value** in case the primary key is unexpectedly compromised
- Use an "add new first, remove old later" dual-window rotation strategy
- Set up monitoring so pinning failures trigger a fast rollback of the client configuration
:::

## Certificate Pinning and Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for only 90 days and renew frequently. Pinning the leaf certificate directly would require updating the pinned value every 90 days — high maintenance cost. Recommended strategies:

| Pinned target | Validity | Renewal impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| Leaf certificate | 90 days | Pinned value must be updated on every renewal | Low |
| Let's Encrypt intermediate | ~5 years | Update only when the intermediate rotates (every few years) | Recommended |
| Your domain's public key (if self-hosted) | Controlled by you | Update only when you deliberately rotate the key | Case by case |

Let's Encrypt intermediates (such as R3, R10, R11) are valid for years; pinning the intermediate's SPKI balances security with low maintenance. When Let's Encrypt rotates its intermediate, it announces this in advance, leaving plenty of time to update the pinned value.

```go
// Pin the Let's Encrypt intermediate certificate (recommended)
pinner, err := httpc.NewSPKIHashPinner(
    "YLh1dUR9y6Kja30RrAn7JKnbQG/uEtLMkBgFF2fuihg=", // current intermediate
    "C5+lpZ7tcVwmwQIMcRtPbsQtWLABXhQzejna0wHFr8M=", // backup / next-round intermediate
)
```

:::tip
Let's Encrypt's intermediate-certificate public key usually stays unchanged across rotations (a new certificate is issued but the public key is reused). Pinning the public-key SPKI is more stable than pinning the full intermediate certificate — when the public key is unchanged, the SPKI hash is unchanged.
:::

## Security Considerations for Certificate Pinning

| Risk | Consequence | Mitigation |
|------|------|---------|
| Pinned value expired / not matching | Connection fails completely | Multiple hashes + backup keys + monitoring |
| Backup key lost | Cannot rotate, lockout | Offline-backup multiple key pairs |
| Pinned values hardcoded | Update requires a release | Dynamic loading from a config center (custom Pinner) |
| Pinning only one layer | Single point of failure | Pin multiple layers (leaf + intermediate) |

:::warning
Certificate pinning is a double-edged sword: it greatly improves defense against MITM/CA compromise, but a pinning failure causes a hard outage. Before adopting it, ensure:
1. You have a reliable mechanism for updating and distributing pinned values
2. You monitor the pinning-failure rate and set alerts
3. You retain an emergency "disable pinning" switch (at the cost of reduced security)
:::

### Pinning Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Security | Maintenance cost | Recommended scenario |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Pin root certificate | Low | Low | Tamper protection only; CA scope too broad |
| Pin intermediate certificate | Medium | Medium | **Recommended**; balances security and maintenance |
| Pin leaf certificate | High | High | High security; certificate under your control |
| Pin multiple levels | High | Medium | Best; multi-layer redundancy |

## InsecureSkipVerify

`InsecureSkipVerify` skips all TLS certificate-chain validation and is for testing only:

```go
// Testing only!
cfg := httpc.TestingConfig()
// InsecureSkipVerify = true -> skips TLS certificate verification
```

When HTTPC detects `InsecureSkipVerify = true` in `httpc.New()` and the environment is not a test environment, it prints a warning to `stderr` (once per process). A test environment is identified by an executable ending in `.test`, or the `GO_TEST` / `GOTEST=1` environment variable being set.

:::danger
`InsecureSkipVerify = true` disables all TLS security measures (certificate pinning is also void); use it only in test environments. Never set it to `true` in production. If you need custom verification logic (e.g. pinning the full certificate), implement the `CertificatePinner` interface instead of skipping verification.
:::

## HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is enabled by default and is only available when using TLS (h2 via ALPN):

```go
cfg := httpc.DefaultConfig()
cfg.Connection.EnableHTTP2 = false // Disable HTTP/2 (HTTP/1.1 only)
```

:::tip
When certificate pinning or a custom `TLSConfig` is enabled, HTTP/2's ALPN negotiation still works normally. To disable HTTP/2 (e.g. for debugging or compatibility with legacy proxies), set `EnableHTTP2 = false`.
:::

## Best Practices

1. Use the default TLS configuration (TLS 1.2+) — no manual setup needed
2. When pinning, pin the **intermediate certificate** SPKI and prepare backup pins
3. Use multiple hashes to support key rotation with an "add new first, remove old later" strategy
4. Periodically update pinned values in sync with server-certificate renewals
5. Use `SecureConfig()` as a security baseline
6. Never set `InsecureSkipVerify` in production
7. For high-security scenarios, pin multiple certificate layers (leaf + intermediate) for redundancy
