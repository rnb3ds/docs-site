# Core Concepts

Understanding the following concepts will give you a quick, holistic grasp of HTTPC.

## Core Building Blocks at a Glance

| Component | Responsibility | Key Points |
|------|------|--------|
| `Client` (interface) | Executes requests; manages the connection pool and lifecycle | Created via `New(cfg)` / `NewDefault()`; 7 verb methods + `Request` + `Download` + `Close` |
| `Doer` (interface) | Minimal request interface | A single `Request(ctx, method, url, opts...)` method; used for mocks and custom implementations |
| `RequestOption` (`With*` functions) | Builds a single request | Functional options; applied in the order passed; the first failure aborts the request immediately |
| `MiddlewareFunc` / `Handler` | Middleware and terminal handler | Onion model; composed with `Chain(mw...)` |
| `RequestMutator` / `ResponseMutator` | Read/write views of the request/response inside middleware | Read/write the request in the request phase, the response in the response phase |
| `SessionManager` | Session-state store | Thread safe; manages cookies and common request headers uniformly |
| `DomainClienter` (interface) | Domain client | Binds a base URL + embedded session; relative paths are joined automatically |
| `Result` | Response wrapper | Three-part structure (request/response/metadata); nil-safe accessors; reclaimed by GC automatically |
| `ClientError` | Network-layer error classification | Extract with `errors.As`; `Code()` / `IsRetryable()` / `Attempts` |

How the components relate:

          (optional)              security/retry         streaming file
          Chain(mw...)                                   download
                 │                     │
                 ▼                     ▼
          RequestMutator        Result (Request / Response / Meta)

DomainClienter = Client + base URL + SessionManager
(injects session headers/cookies before each request, writes Set-Cookie back after each response)
```

## Two-Layer API Architecture

HTTPC provides two equivalent ways to make requests, mirroring the relationship between `http.Get` and `http.Client` in the standard library `net/http`:

**Package-level functions** — zero configuration; they share a lazily-initialized default client internally. Suitable for scripts and one-off requests:

```go
result, err := httpc.Get("https://api.example.com/data")
```

**Client instances** — full control over configuration, connection pools, and lifecycle. Suitable for long-running services:

```go
client, err := httpc.NewDefault()
defer func() { _ = client.Close() }()
result, err := client.Get("https://api.example.com/data")
```

Both approaches accept the same request options (`WithHeader`, `WithJSON`, ...) and return the same `*Result` type. Package-level functions are thin wrappers around Client instances. The default client is replaceable: `SetDefaultClient(client)` installs a custom instance as the default (the old instance is closed automatically), and `CloseDefaultClient()` closes and resets it — after a close, the next package-level call rebuilds it automatically.

:::tip When to use which?
One-off requests or quick prototypes -> package-level functions. Production services, custom configuration, or connection-pool management -> Client instances.

## Configuration System: Config vs With\* Options

HTTPC splits configuration into two independent layers to avoid confusion:

| Layer | Carrier | Scope | Typical fields |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| **Instance configuration** | `Config` struct | Entire client lifetime | Timeouts, retry strategy, connection pool, TLS |
| **Request options** | `WithXxx()` functions | Single request | `WithHeader`, `WithJSON`, `WithTimeout` |

Instance configuration is passed to `New()` via the `Config` struct, starting from `DefaultConfig()` and modified as needed:

```go
cfg := httpc.DefaultConfig()
cfg.Timeouts.Request = 60 * time.Second
cfg.Retry.MaxRetries = 5
client, err := httpc.New(cfg)
```

Request options are passed on each call to supplement or override instance-level defaults:

```go
result, err := client.Get(url,
    httpc.WithHeader("Authorization", "Bearer "+token),
    httpc.WithTimeout(30*time.Second),
)
```

You can also start from preset configurations (`SecureConfig()`, `PerformanceConfig()`, etc.). See the [Config API](../api-reference/client-config/config).

Configuration across the library follows one convention: the main `Config` and `SessionConfig` are **passed by value** (required); middleware configs are **passed by pointer**, where passing `nil` means using the defaults; `DownloadConfig` is passed by pointer and requires `FilePath` to be set. Every `XxxConfig` has a matching `DefaultXxxConfig()` constructor — start from the defaults and adjust fields as needed. This is the consistent HTTPC configuration idiom.

## Request Lifecycle

Every request goes through the following flow:

```text
Options applied -> Middleware chain (if any) -> Engine execution -> Retry (if needed) -> Result returned
    ^                                       ^
  With* functions                  Connection pool / TLS / proxy / SSRF checks
```

Stage-by-stage details:

- **Options applied** — `With*` functions set request headers, body, timeouts, and so on; they run in the order passed, and any option returning an error (e.g. a header failing CRLF validation) fails the request immediately.
- **Middleware chain** — active when `Config.Middleware.Middlewares` is configured; the request passes through middleware in registration order, and the terminal Handler hands the (possibly modified) request to the engine. With no middleware configured, the request goes straight to the engine with zero extra overhead.
- **Engine execution** — URL/header validation (on by default) -> SSRF dial check (private IPs blocked by default) -> DNS resolution (optional DoH) -> take a connection from the pool (create one if short, bounded by `MaxConnsPerHost`) -> TLS handshake (version policy, optional certificate pinning) -> send the request -> read the response (response-body size and decompression caps checked).
- **Retry** — Retryable conditions: timeouts, transport errors, most transient network errors, plus status codes 408/429/500/502/503/504. Backoff is `Delay × BackoffFactor^n` plus jitter, with each wait capped at `MaxRetryDelay`; a `Retry-After` response header takes precedence (capped at 60s). The total duration is bounded by `Timeouts.Request` or `WithTimeout` — **the timeout budget is shared across retries** and does not reset each round.
- **Result** — carries the response data, request metadata, and retry statistics; internal engine objects are pooled but transparent to callers, and `Result` is reclaimed by GC automatically — no manual release required.

Exhausted retries end one of two ways:

- **Network errors exhausted** -> an `error` is returned (`ClientError.Attempts` records the attempt count);
- **Retryable status codes (e.g. 503) exhausted** -> the **last response** is returned (`result.StatusCode() == 503`, with `Meta.Attempts` recording the total), and the caller handles the status code.

## Middleware Model

A middleware is a function of the form `func(Handler) Handler` (`MiddlewareFunc`); `Handler` is the signature of the function that actually processes the request:

```go
type Handler func(ctx context.Context, req RequestMutator) (ResponseMutator, error)
type MiddlewareFunc func(Handler) Handler
```

Middleware is registered on `Config.Middleware.Middlewares` and composed into an onion model by `Chain(middlewares...)`: **wrapped in registration order** — the first middleware is the outermost layer; the request phase runs in order, the response phase in reverse.

Skeleton of a custom middleware:

```go
func TimingMiddleware(report func(d time.Duration)) httpc.MiddlewareFunc {
    return func(next httpc.Handler) httpc.Handler {
        return func(ctx context.Context, req httpc.RequestMutator) (httpc.ResponseMutator, error) {
            start := time.Now()
            resp, err := next(ctx, req)        // Call the inner layer (next middleware or the engine)
            report(time.Since(start))          // Response-phase logic (runs in reverse order)
            return resp, err
        }
    }
}
```

Built-in middleware at a glance:

| Middleware | Responsibility | Behavior with nil config |
|--------|------|------------------|
| `LoggingMiddleware` | Emits request/response summaries (URLs redacted automatically) | Logging disabled (no-op) |
| `RecoveryMiddleware` | Catches panics inside the chain and converts them to errors | — |
| `RequestIDMiddleware` | Injects `X-Request-ID` (generated with crypto/rand) | Default header name and secure generator |
| `TimeoutMiddleware` | Middleware-layer timeout (takes effect ahead of the client's built-in timeout) | Timeout disabled (passthrough) |
| `MetricsMiddleware` | Per-request callback (method/URL/status/duration/error) | Metrics disabled (no-op) |
| `AuditMiddleware` | Compliance audit events (text/json formats, sensitive headers redacted) | Default text config |
| `HeaderMiddleware` | Attaches static headers to every request (CRLF validated at creation) | No headers (passthrough) |

:::warning Do not use for Download or streaming requests
`TimeoutMiddleware` is not suitable for `Download` or `WithStreamBody(true)` requests — it cancels the context as soon as the handler returns (once the response headers have been received), which makes reading the response body fail with "context canceled". Use `WithTimeout` for such cases instead.
:::

## Sessions and the Domain Client

For consecutive requests to the same domain (login state, common headers, cookie pass-through), use a `DomainClient` instead of hand-building URLs and passing cookies on every call:

```go
dc, err := httpc.NewDomainDefault("https://api.example.com")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer dc.Close()

dc.SetHeader("Authorization", "Bearer "+token) // Session header: sent automatically on subsequent requests

_, _ = dc.Post("/login", httpc.WithJSON(creds)) // Set-Cookie from the response enters the session automatically
_, _ = dc.Get("/me")                            // Session cookies attached automatically
```

Division of labor between the two components:

- **`DomainClient`** — binds a base URL; relative paths are joined automatically (`/users` -> `https://api.example.com/users`), while full `http(s)://` URLs are used as-is; it has built-in path-traversal protection (an error is returned if the joined result escapes the base path). A cookie jar is enabled automatically at creation.
- **`SessionManager`** — a thread-safe session-state store (cookies + headers); `DomainClient` embeds it: before each request it injects session state into the request options, and after the response it writes `Set-Cookie` back. It can also be used standalone (`NewSessionManagerDefault()`).

:::warning Request options are applied twice
Request options passed to a `DomainClient` are applied **twice** internally — once to capture session state (cookies/headers) and once to perform the real request. Avoid placing side-effecting logic in options (counters, one-time nonces, etc.).

See the [Domain Client & Sessions guide](../guides/domain-session).

## Secure Defaults

HTTPC is secure by default and requires no extra configuration to gain:

- **TLS 1.2+** enforced encryption
- **SSRF protection** — blocks connections to private/reserved IP addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `10.x`, `192.168.x`, etc.)
- **CRLF injection protection** — automatic validation of request headers and URLs
- **Response body size limit** — 10MB by default, preventing memory exhaustion
- **Decompression-bomb guardrail** — decompressed response bodies capped at 100MB by default
- **Strict Content-Length validation** — on by default; errors when the body length does not match the declared value

To connect to internal services (VPN, intranet), set `Security.AllowPrivateIPs = true` or use `SSRFExemptCIDRs` for precise exemptions. See the [Security Overview](../security/).

## Error Model

HTTPC distinguishes **network-layer errors** from **HTTP status codes**:

- **Network-layer errors** (connection failures, timeouts, TLS errors, etc.) -> returned as `error`; use `errors.As` to extract a `ClientError` for classification and retryability
- **HTTP status codes** (4xx, 5xx) -> **not** returned as `error`; check them via methods like `result.IsSuccess()`

```go
result, err := client.Get(url)
if err != nil {
    // Network-layer error — the request did not complete successfully
    var clientErr *httpc.ClientError
    if errors.As(err, &clientErr) {
        log.Printf("Error type: %s, retryable: %v", clientErr.Code(), clientErr.IsRetryable())
    }
    return err
}
// Request completed successfully — check the HTTP status code
if !result.IsSuccess() {
    log.Printf("HTTP error: %d", result.StatusCode())
}
```

The context carried by `ClientError`:

| Member | Description |
|------|------|
| `Type` | Error classification (`ErrorTypeTimeout`, `ErrorTypeNetwork`, etc. — a 12-value enum) |
| `Code()` | Short code string: `TIMEOUT`, `NETWORK_ERROR`, `TLS_ERROR`, `DNS_ERROR`, `CONTEXT_CANCELED`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `HTTP_ERROR`, etc. |
| `IsRetryable()` | Whether a retry is worthwhile (context cancellation/validation/TLS/certificate always false; timeout/transport always true; network/DNS/5xx depend on the cause) |
| `Attempts` | Attempts made so far (including the first) |
| `StatusCode` | Associated HTTP status code (if applicable) |
| `Cause` | Underlying error; transparent to `errors.Is` / `errors.As` |
| `URL` / `Method` | Redacted request URL and request method |

Common sentinel errors can be matched with `errors.Is`: `ErrClientClosed` (using a closed client), `ErrResponseBodyEmpty` (`Unmarshal` on an empty body), `ErrResponseBodyTooLarge` (parse body over 50MB), and more — see [Error Types](../api-reference/types/errors) for the full list.

See [Error Handling](../guides/error-handling).

## Concurrency and Resource Management

- **Client concurrency safety** — one client can be shared by any number of goroutines; the connection pool is managed per host internally, so there is no need to create separate clients for concurrency.
- **Result is independent and release-free** — every request returns a brand-new `*Result` (allocated once together with its three metadata structs); holding it carries no lifecycle burden — leave it to the GC.
- **Explicit Close** — `client.Close()` releases the connection pool and transport resources; requests after a close return `ErrClientClosed`.
- **Self-healing default client** — the default client behind package-level functions can be replaced with `SetDefaultClient()` and closed with `CloseDefaultClient()`; after a close, the next package-level call rebuilds it automatically.
- **Panic safety net** — `Request` has an internal recover fallback: unexpected panics on the execution path are converted into an `error` with a stack trace instead of crashing through to the caller.
